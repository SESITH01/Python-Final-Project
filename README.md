We assembled a simple 'Hangman' game, pulling random words from a csv file and incorporating a point system. 

For our CSE-120 group project, our group decided to turn a simple game into a new and improved version: ultimate hangman. The game is a traditional play on the game hangman with a few added features. Upon starting the game, the user will be prompted with an empty “gallows” hangman image and blank spaces that correlate with the number of letters from the imported .csv words. As the user guesses the correct letters, the spaces will fill with the corresponding letter and 1 point will be gained. If the user guesses incorrectly the hangman will gain a “limb” and the incorrectly guessed letters will be listed under the wrong guesses along with 0.5 points gained. The user has six attempts to guess the correct letters, or the game will end with a simple “The Game is Over” message and the correct word will be displayed. Our group used tools acquired from CSE-120 to form a functioning program.
