# About
Welcome to our 2022 Fall Final Group Project in Intro to Python!

## Overview

For our CSE-120 group project, we transformed the classic game of hangman into an enhanced version called "Ultimate Hangman." This new rendition of the game includes additional features to make the gameplay more engaging and challenging.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players are presented with an empty "gallows" hangman image and blank spaces representing the letters of the word to be guessed from an imported .csv file.
- **Letter Guessing:** Players input their guesses for letters. Correct guesses fill in the corresponding blank spaces, while incorrect guesses result in the hangman gaining a "limb" and displaying the incorrectly guessed letters.
- **Scoring System:** Players earn points for correct guesses and partial points for incorrect guesses, adding an extra layer of strategy to the game.
- **Limited Attempts:** Players have six attempts to guess the word correctly. If unsuccessful, the game ends with a "The Game is Over" message and reveals the correct word.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run the Python script to start the game.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to play Ultimate Hangman.
